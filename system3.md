Daniel Kahnemans groundbreaking book [Thinking, Fast and Slow][thinking] talks about your two systems in your mind that he refers to as System 1 and System 2.
System 1 is your aware conscious mind, and System 2 is your autopilot conscious mind.  The book is amazing you should really check it out.  A [summary][thinking-summary] if you still aren't sold.
I'm calling System 3 a new addition to our minds that will be invented in the next 30 years that will allow us to interface with external systems.
In this context its a page on my blog that I store top-of-mind items in that I update as those items change.
