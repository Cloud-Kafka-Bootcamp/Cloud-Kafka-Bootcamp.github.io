I don't know if its just me or what but I'm having trouble understanding how to set up a Github Pages site with Jekyll.  
Doing these things individually is easy.  Setting up a Github Pages site was straightforward.  Setting up a local jekyll site was also relatively easy, there were a bunch of dependent things I had to install like Ruby but that wasn't a problem for me.
Now the question is how do I set the two up together.
